# üí° LightRotations - SoD

[![.NET Build](https://github.com/ferib/LightRotations/actions/workflows/master.yml/badge.svg?branch=classic_era)](https://github.com/ferib/LightRotations/actions/workflows/master.yml)

[LightRotations](https://github.com/ferib/LightRotations) is a combat rotations framework based on [DarkRotations](https://gitlab.com/dark_rotations).

![LightRotations UI](./img/lightrotations.jpg)

## Summary
The purpose of the framework is similar to something like WeakAuras2 as its goal is to enhance your combat gameplay, but it does so in a unique way. LightRotations allows you to easily create 'class profiles' aka '[combat rotations](./rotations/)' for a given class or spec, these combat rotations can then be used to assist you during your gameplay.

### Example Use
![in-game AddOn on a Rogue](./img/demo_rogue.jpg)

The UI prompts which spells to cast in the UI as well as highlight the spells in your action bars _(if found, does __not work with macros!__)_

## in-game commands

```
/dr move		Locks and unlocks the button frame for moving
/dr econf		Shows the core engine config window
/dr load x		Loads the specified rotation name x
/dr help		Display the list of known commands
/dr list		List available rotations
/dr toggle x	Toggles the on/off state of the specified button name x
/dr debug lvl	Enable the debug console at the specific debug level (0-6)
/dr size		Adjusts the size of the on-screen buttons/UI
```

## ‚öîÔ∏è Combat Rotations

The current rotations included are a work in progress as I only recently picked TBC back up, however, I tend to update these as I go.

### üîê PROTECTED Lua and Vanilla Wow
Wow introduced protected Lua somewhere around patch 2.x, __LightRotations does NOT support PROTECTED Lua APIs__, however, we provide a way to [downgrade to Vanilla Wow](./docs/vanilla_wow.md).


## ‚ö† Warning: AddOn Name Detection
It is public knowledge that AddOn names are uploaded to the game server for analysis! Both folder/toc names *(`Light`, `Light.toc`)* and Lua globals `_G.Light` may be tracked.
